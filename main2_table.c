/*main function has a call to table() and invoking main() for re-login used to reset the structure and the deductions were lost,so I copied 
everything of the main function into another function called main2() which is basically the amin function without he table() invoking so the
structure is not resetted after every call from again() and quit() during Re-login and structure keeps a track of the deductions that happened and 
in this way I also removed the Welcome sentence to the same user,but he main reason is to avoid rewriting of the structure on every call 
and losing the deduction data*/
